<h1><i>P<sup>3</sup></i>:  Peacock Pumpkin Projectiles</h1>

<!-- Background of pseudo-business-->
<h2>Why did we start this business?</h2>

<p1>One year we built a new coop for our laying hens and turkeys.
The end result was a weather-tight sturdy coop ... and some leftover lumber.  
The weather that summer was also perfect for pumpkin growth.  Having made all the muffins and 
pies we could handle, foisting them onto our friends, we were still left 
with too many pumpkins. </p1>

<h3>The solution? Launch Them in a Trebuchet!</h3>

<p2> We reached out to YouTube to see how to build one

(Click <a href="https://youtu.be/-gn2RGPqe_A" target="_blank"

to customers who want to host an event to see who can fling a pumpkin the farthest.  This year's results were the best ever!</p2>

<!-- Explanation of a Trebuchet from wikipedia-->
<!-- from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet-->
<h4>What is a Trebuchet?</h4>
<p2> According to Wikipedia, a counterweight trebuchet, consists primarily of a long beam attached by an axle suspended high 
above the ground by a stout frame and base, such that the beam can rotate vertically through a wide arc (typically over 180°). 
A sling is attached to one end of the beam to hold the projectile. The projectile is thrown when the beam is quickly rotated 
by applying force to the opposite end of the beam. The mechanical advantage is primarily obtained by having the projectile 
section of the beam much longer than the opposite section where the force is applied – usually four to six times longer.</p2>
